This folder is a collection of programs and csv files that were made by Patricia Cahn, Olivia Del Guercio, Jack Kendrick, and Hana Sambora.

In order to run our programs, you should have Python 3 and sympy installed in your path.
The program three_colorings.py isn't being used to compile our data currently. 
The program colorings.py is Professor Cahn's original program, with our comments, that calculates the dihedral linking number in two ways. We used this to create our other programs.

The order to use the programs is: 
1) gauss_to_overstrand.py and gauss_to_signlist.py
2) overstrand_to_matrix.py
3) matrix_to_rrematrix.py
4) rrematrix_to_colourlist.py
5) dihedral_linking.py (You will need to pick one coloring from the previous program's output if calculating for a single knot)

The program csv_read_write.py is also able to use any of the above programs on a .csv file of knots, with a menu for ease of use.
